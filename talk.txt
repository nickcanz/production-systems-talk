CAP:
  - original theorem
  - also applies to system architecture in general
  - with most modern internet sites, there is only really one choice, AP
  - make the realization that to add to one stat, have to subtract from another (like D&D char sheet)

CQRS:
  - again, with most modern internet sites, the "reading" and "writing" are like 2 separate applications
    - so why not make it 2 separate things
    - orders of magnitude more reads, so can 10 servers that can handle reads and 1 server to handle writes
  - the reads:
    - don't modify the system
    - ideally, query a cache (redis, memcached, etc) or a read-only database slave
    - if you do need to modify the system, do it asynchronously

  - the writes:
    - do it asynchronously so you can immediately return
      - perform validation and return Accepted/Not accepted
    - fake it till you make it
      - attempt to update users UI immediately, even though other users won't see it

Message Queueing:
  - our way of handling asynchronous tasks
  - choose the implementation to suit your needs
    - reliability guarantees vs high throughput/low latency vs complex routing/publishing scenarios
  - dead letter saves to db/disk and is replayable pattern

Releasing your software:
  * no interruption in services
  * We were inspired by books like scalable internet architectures and release it
  * Rolling releases - helped by the redundant architecture
  * Schema concerns: must work with current version and next version of software - they'll both be running at the same time! if only during a release
  * this is also true of:
    * message queue entries, job schemas
    * configuration files
    * service endpoints
    * internal APIs
  * api versioning is a thing
    * support multiple client versions, decouples your partners (and your own other services) from having to upgrade at the exact same time you do
    * seems like more work, but turns out to be less than trying to synchronize 3am Saturday night releases with vendors
    * lets you get new features into your system ahead of 'real' usage, allows you to test, and get experience with them before 'go live' time
    * you _must_ remember to deprecate data model warts, remove old APIs
  
What should be in source control:
  * system configuration definitions (chef)
  * your software's configuration
  * logging configuration
  * database schema

Your career:
  - go to user groups
  - do stuff on github
  - give talks - it's scary but you will probably learn more than your audience
  - even minor stuff immediately puts you in the top 10% of applicants
